                I am a mum of one and a hypnobirthing enthusiast. I started
                Mighty Fierce Birth to to support others prepare for the
                positive birth they deserve and can have!
              </p>
              <p>
                As someone who was always terrified and anxious about birth, I
                decided to do a hypnobirthing course to tackle some of these
                fears and educate myself further. My friend Jade at The Birth
                Uprising kindly offered me a private course. It was amazing and
                I was hooked from the beginning!
              </p>
              <p>
                Hypnobirthing really changed how I thought about birth as I went
                from someone who was clueless, anxious and scared to someone who
                was calm, positive and ready!
              </p>
              <p>
                Although my birth didn't go exactly to plan, I was prepared and
                calm throughout. I felt in control and I was able to have a
                drug-free birth like I had initially wanted. I believe this was
                all down to hypnobirthing!
